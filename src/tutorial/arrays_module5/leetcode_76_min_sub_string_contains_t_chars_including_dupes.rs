// Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum
// window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates)
// is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty
// string "".
//
// I have no idea why they always have to have questions that sound like it comes
// out of a set theory math book, they basically asking find us the smallest,
// substring of s that include at least 1 of each of the characters of t.
//
// Well its going to be a sliding window problem for sure... since we wouldn't
// want to revisit stuff in s already processed.
//
// like wise we would want to reduce t to some sort of easily verifiable value on
// the slice of s under examination.
// -- algo idea: I think this will work--
// So I guess we need a hashmap of all characters in t first called thash and record
// the length of thash as thlen. Then we process s with a left/right boundry variable
// sliding window starting at l=0 r=0 with a hashmap called shash and building the
// state machine which works in steps of find qualifying window, contract left,
// slide smallest window right till finding the next qualifying window, and then
// looping back into the contract left step repeating and so on.
//
// Every time r+=1 occurs we increment a count of the occurances of the string's [r-1]
// position in the shash, every time we l+=1 we decrement the count of the occurances
// of the l-1 character from shash, if it falls to 0 we remove it from shash.
//
// In the 3 steps mentioned, when a comparison is needed if the window is a qualifying
// window or not check every element in thash if it has an element in shash. This part
// I don't really know how to make faster..., but I'm thinking on it.. faster aproaches
// must exist... Hmm maybe I can think of something faster, what if:
//      I keep a extra variable match_count whenever I add a new element in shash which
//      already exists in t I increment the match count.
//      Whenever the shash falls to a count of 0 and the element is removed we decrement
//      match_count, therefore if match_count==thlen then the current window qualifies.
// Yes this will work.
// The final result should be O(n+t)
//
//
// OK so I originally made a mistake: duplicate characters in t means that
// the result from s should have the same number of duplicates,
// this means that when thashmap is constructed the value portion of each
// required character key should be a count of how many is required.
//
// Then instead of comparing match_count = thash.len() to determine validity
// we compare match_count to thash.sum()
// this necesitates one additional change: instead of increasing match_count
// on the first itteration a new char gets added into shash we need to keep
// incrementing match_count while the count of the character in shash is <
// the count of the character in thash.
// Likewise instead of decrementing when shash's character value reaches 0
// we will now decrement while shash's value is moved < thash for said character
//
// NOTE THE ABOVE VARIABLE NAMES ETC IS NOT WHATS USED IN THE CODE.
